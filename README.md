## Experience

The development of this application has been a valuable learning experience for me. On the Spring Boot side, I improved my handling of endpoint responses and requests, opting for MongoDB over JPARepository, and delving into Docker to create a streamlined application image.

On the frontend, I made better use of components compared to previous projects. I encountered challenges with token handling in headers for backend requests, prompting me to delve into the intricacies of browser behavior regarding header-based requests. After some investigation, I successfully implemented a solution. I acknowledge that there's always room for improvement, particularly in how I manage application data. As the application grows, I anticipate the need to further abstract components and functions for optimal performance.

## Future

Continual Enhancement!!
